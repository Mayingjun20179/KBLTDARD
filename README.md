#KBLTDARD

Matlab code of Kernel Bayesian logistic tensor decomposition with automatic rank determination for predicting multiple types of miRNA-disease associations

(Written by Yingjun Ma,2024)

We provide one demo code: mianZ.m

KBLTD_ARD.m：Kernel Bayesian logistic tensor decomposition with automatic rank determination.


The package includes two benchmark datasets:

data_v2.mat：Benchmark dataset for HMDD v2.0
data_v32.mat： Benchmark dataset for HMDD v3.2

In this package, we used the tensor_toolbox-v3.1, which is downloaded from (https://gitlab.com/tensors/tensor_toolbox/-/releases/v3.1)
